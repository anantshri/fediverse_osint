# fediverse_osint
OSINT on fediverse Instances

Fediverse is catching up like wild fire. We need to some basic tooling to understand how things are working. Due to the open nature of protocols a lot of details are available if you check the right api.

This tool as of now performs following activities.

Current Status:

- [X] Check if a given domain belongs to fediverse or not
- [X] Check if a given username belongs to the given server or not
- [X] Hunt for a username across known discoverable fediverse servers

Future Scope:

- [ ] Extract User profile details and URL's.
- [ ] If url is verified on mastodon instances mark them as such
and more...
